# 3D Printed Flat Puzzle Box

This is a 3d printed box that opens when its sliders are set to the correct code.  It's written for OpenSCAD and is designed to be customizable and flexible, supporting a wide range of sizes, dimensions, scales, and other options.

## Components

- Inner Box: The inside part of the box that comes out when opened.
- Outer Box A & B: The outside portion of the box prints in 2 parts that need to be glued together; the main body, and the top.
- Sliders: One slider for each position in the code.  Each slider is specific to its digit/letter/whatever.  You only need to print the sliders needed for your code.
